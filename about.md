# About

Just a gamer (Grand)dad who's been gaming since before the internet. I'm a lifelong gamer and computer enthusiast starting when I was a child.  We never had game consoles in our home, no Atari, no Nintendo etc.

Our first in-home PC was an old Atari 520ST back in the 80s.  This was an amazing machine for its time, when other people around us had IBM XTs pre-Windows, we had a full color graphical GUI PC with a mouse and everything.  Some of the first "PC" games I remember playing were the original [King's Quests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_I), [Space Quests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_I) on the Atari ST and of course [The Oregon Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(1985_video_game)) on Apple II in grade school.

See the following [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST) if you're interested in learning more about the Atari ST system.

After that exposure to computers, I couldn't get enough.  I bought my own Commodore 64 when I was still a pre-teen by doing neighborhood odd-jobs for people.  A little later I bought a used PC from a neighbor in trade for yard work and housesitting while he was gone from home (he was elderly).  That was my first "typical" PC, running MS-DOS (before Windows).

This love for computers continued into my Junior High and High School years.  During High School I pretty much became kind of the go-to person for many of the teachers for computer help since there was no such thing as an I.T. department for the school yet. During High School I witnessed the birth of what we now call the Internet.  Early to Mid 90s we saw the initial version of the Web Browser called [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic).  This to me was a major event and I clearly remember being in the school library and helping install it and get it running for our school, which was likely the first time anybody there saw anything like this.

Towards the end of high school I was already working in a local computer shop doing PC builds, sales and support for our customers.  I worked here for a few years doing those jobs and learned some Novell Netware along the way.

Since then I've had a career in I.T. working my way up from computer technical to network admin, to senior system administrator and now into I.T. management.

I'm now a grandpa of four and still have my love of gaming. You're never too old for gaming.

Thanks for reading.
